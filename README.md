# DevOps Labs – Raspberry Pi Learning Environment

This repository contains my hands-on DevOps learning journey, fully executed on a Raspberry Pi 5 running Linux.  
The goal is to build practical, production-like experience across the full DevOps toolchain, including automation, scripting, infrastructure, CI/CD, containers, and Kubernetes.

## 🧩 Purpose

This project serves as a long-term DevOps sandbox where I practice:

- Linux administration  
- Bash scripting & automation  
- Git branching workflows  
- Docker containerization  
- Kubernetes (K3s on Raspberry Pi)  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)  
- Monitoring & logging (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)  
- Real-world DevOps practices

## 🧪 Completed Labs

### ✔ **Lab 1 – Basic Bash System Monitor**
Path: `phase-1-linux/labs/lab1-basic-bash/`

A simple Linux monitoring script that logs CPU load and RAM usage into a timestamped logfile.  
Built to practice Bash, system metrics, logging, and foundational automation.

## 🚀 Upcoming Labs

- Git workflow (feature branches, PRs, merges)
- Docker fundamentals
- Deploying applications with Docker Compose
- Building a local Kubernetes cluster using K3s
- Service deployment using Helm
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline deploying to the Raspberry Pi
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Monitoring stack setup (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki)

## 🧠 About This Project

This repository is part of my structured DevOps learning roadmap.  
All labs are executed **on real hardware (Raspberry Pi 5)** to stay close to production environments and avoid artificial “toy” examples.

More labs, documentation, and automation will be added continuously as the journey progresses.
